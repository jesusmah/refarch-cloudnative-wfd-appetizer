# Microservices Reference Application - What's For Dinner

## Appetizer Service - MicroProfile

This repository contains the **Java MicroProfile** implementation of the **Appetizer Service** which is a part of microservice-based reference application called **What's For Dinner** that can be found in https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-cloudnative-wfd

### Introduction

This project demonstrates the implementation of Appetizer Microservice. The appetizer microservice retrieves the list of appetizers from its data store. 

- Based on [MicroProfile](https://microprofile.io/).
- Integrated with the [MicroService Builder](https://developer.ibm.com/microservice-builder/).
- Deployment options for local, Docker Container-based runtimes, Minikube environment and ICP/BMX.

### How it works

Appetizer Microservice serves [**What's For Dinner**](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-cloudnative-wfd), Microservice-based reference application. Though it is a part of a bigger application, Appetizer service is itself an application in turn that gets the data from data store. This service reads the data and returns it through a REST service.

### Endpoints

```
GET     /WfdAppetizer/rest/health/        # Health check of the service
GET     /WfdAppetizer/rest/appetizer/     # Returns the appetizers available
```

### Implementation

#### [MicroProfile](https://microprofile.io/)

MicroProfile is an open platform that optimizes the Enterprise Java for microservices architecture. In this application, we are using [**MicroProfile 1.2**](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-bom). This includes

- MicroProfile 1.0 ([JAX-RS 2.0](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=339), [CDI 1.2](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=346), and [JSON-P 1.0](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=353))
- MicroProfile 1.1 (MicroProfile 1.0, [MicroProfile Config 1.0.](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config))
- [MicroProfile Config 1.1](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config) (supercedes MicroProfile Config 1.0), [MicroProfile Fault Tolerance 1.0](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-fault-tolerance), [MicroProfile Health Check 1.0](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-health), [MicroProfile Metrics 1.0](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-metrics), [MicroProfile JWT Authentication 1.0](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-jwt-auth).

You can make use of this feature by including this dependency in Maven.

```
<dependency>
<groupId>org.eclipse.microprofile</groupId>
<artifactId>microprofile</artifactId>
<version>1.2</version>
<type>pom</type>
<scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```

#### Maven build

Maven is a project management tool that is based on the Project Object Model (POM). Typically, people use Maven for project builds, dependencies, and documentation. Maven simplifies the project build. In this task, you use Maven to build the project.

For Liberty, there is nice tool called [Liberty Accelerator](https://liberty-app-accelerator.wasdev.developer.ibm.com/start/) that generates a simple project based upon your configuration. Using this, you can build and deploy to Liberty either using the Maven or Gradle build. 

**Pic1**

Just check the options of your choice and click Generate project. You can either Download it as a zip or you can create git project.

**Pic2**

Once you are done with this, you will have a sample microprofile based application that you can deploy on Liberty.

If you are using Liberty accelerator, look for the generated POM. It may contain unwanted dependencies. Please remove accordingly.

For our application, the following are the required dependencies which are the part of auto-generated POM. Please remove the rest of the dependencies.

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>junit</groupId>
    <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
    <version>4.12</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.cxf</groupId>
    <artifactId>cxf-rt-rs-client</artifactId>
    <version>3.1.11</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.glassfish</groupId>
    <artifactId>javax.json</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.4</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

Using Liberty Accelerator is your choice. You can also create the entire project manually, but using Liberty Accelerator will make things easier.






#### Docker file

We are using Docker to containerize the application. With Docker, you can pack, ship, and run applications on a portable, lightweight container that can run anywhere virtually.

```
FROM websphere-liberty:microProfile

MAINTAINER IBM Java engineering at IBM Cloud

COPY /target/liberty/wlp/usr/servers/defaultServer /config/
COPY target/liberty/wlp/usr/shared /opt/ibm/wlp/usr/shared/

RUN wget -t 10 -x -nd -P /opt/ibm/wlp/usr https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/net/wasdev/wlp/tracer/liberty-opentracing-zipkintracer/1.0/liberty-opentracing-zipkintracer-1.0-sample.zip && cd /opt/ibm/wlp/usr && unzip liberty-opentracing-zipkintracer-1.0-sample.zip && rm liberty-opentracing-zipkintracer-1.0-sample.zip

# Install required features if not present
RUN installUtility install --acceptLicense defaultServer

CMD ["/opt/ibm/wlp/bin/server", "run", "defaultServer"]
```

- The `FROM` instruction sets the base image. You're setting the base image to `websphere-liberty:microProfile`.
- The `MAINTAINER` instruction sets the Author field. Here it is `IBM Java engineering at IBM Cloud`.
- The `COPY` instruction copies directories and files from a specified source to a destination in the container file system.
  - You're copying the `/target/liberty/wlp/usr/servers/defaultServer` to the `config` directory in the container.
  - You're replacing the contents of `/opt/ibm/wlp/usr/shared/` with the contents of `target/liberty/wlp/usr/shared`.
- The `RUN` instruction runs the commands. 
  - The first instruction gets the Opentracing Zipkin feature and installs it in your server.
  - The second instruction is a precondition to install all the utilities in the server.xml file. You can use the RUN command to install the utilities on the base image.
- The `CMD` instruction provides defaults for an executing container.
